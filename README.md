Custom keystore implementation for Android Keystore Spoofer

## What is this?

This is a complete implementation of the keystore, which fully implements the AOSP AIDL interface, referencing the official AOSP implementation.

In theory, this would make it harder for detectors to identify behavior inconsistent with AOSP, thus achieving greater stealth than the FOSS branch of TrickyStore or other TrickyStore-based module like TEESimulator.

## Install and configure

**Android 12 or above required.**

1. Install this module.

2. [Configure OMK](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) if needed.

3. Change the active keybox.xml from the WebUI (if you need)

The keybox file must contain at least one complete RSA or EC entry, and every
private key present must match its certificate chain. A keybox may contain both
algorithms or only one; RKP-extracted keyboxes are legitimately EC-only. Keep
the XML free of extra content such as watermarks or invisible characters. The
embedded WebUI opens Android's system document picker when installing a
replacement, so the default file manager or another installed storage app such
as MT Manager can provide the file. The picker requests all MIME types; the
WebUI still requires an `.xml` file and the native helper performs the complete
validation. If the system picker cannot be opened, the WebUI falls back to its
shared-storage browser.

The active files are `/data/misc/keystore/omk/config.toml` and
`/data/misc/keystore/omk/injector.toml`. Read the
[Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for complete annotated examples,
field-by-field explanations, safety notes, and restart requirements.

The `[main]` settings `ta_operation_delay_ms`, `ta_generation_delay_ms`, and
`ta_control_delay_ms` in `config.toml` add a fresh random wait before each
covered software TA call. Their default ranges are `[9, 21]`, `[6, 16]`, and
`[1, 4]` milliseconds, including when a field is absent. Set a range to
`[0, 0]` to disable that category. Valid changes apply to new calls without a
restart. These are extra waits, which add to any enabled injector delays;
they do not provide hardware security or guarantee a detector result. See
[TA delay ranges](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#ta-delay-ranges) for coverage and limits.

Optional `injector.toml` settings under `[main]` can mitigate timing-based client
heuristics: `attestation_generation_delay_ms` delays successful challenged key
generation replies, and `operation_start_delay_ms` delays two-way OMK
`createOperation` calls before the RPC, including calls that return business
errors. Both default to `0` (disabled), accept `0..250` milliseconds, and occupy
a Binder worker while waiting. They do not provide hardware security or
guarantee a detector result. See the Configuration Guide before enabling them.

In `injector.toml`, keep the `scoop = [` and closing `]` lines, then add each
exact package name on its own line. Bare entries omit both quotes and commas;
blank lines and lines beginning with `#` are ignored. The traditional quoted,
comma-separated TOML form remains accepted.

## Embedded WebUI

The module includes a WebUI for choosing the exact packages in `scoop`,
installing a local keybox, managing the Android security patch level, and
applying a Pixel PIF fingerprint through OMK's own Zygisk payload. It also
provides an ADB Disabler with independent controls for developer options, USB
debugging, and OEM unlocking:

- In KernelSU, open Oh My Keymint from the module list and select its WebUI.
- In Magisk, open an installed KSUWebUIStandalone or WebUI X host and select
  Oh My Keymint. The module does not install a WebUI host.

The WebUI uses bundled assets for normal operation. **Sync security patch**
uses the module's native HTTPS client to download the Android Security Bulletin
overview from Google's official `source.android.com` host (with its official
Chinese mirror as a fallback), and parses the newest published patch level.
The synchronized value always uses that level's year and month. If the saved
default `ro.build.version.security_patch` ends in day `01`, it uses day `01`;
otherwise it keeps Google's published date. A saved day `05` therefore follows
Google's published date. If the saved system and vendor patch dates disagree,
the system date determines this choice. It does not require `curl` or
`wget` on the device. TLS uses the client's embedded WebPKI roots, and HTTPS
redirects are accepted only when they end at the official bulletin page.
Before the first sync, the
helper records the current `ro.build.version.security_patch` and
`ro.vendor.build.security_patch` values in
`/data/misc/keystore/omk/data/security_patch_defaults.toml`. Later syncs keep
that original snapshot. Each sync writes the selected date to all four
`[trust]` patch-level fields and applies it to both runtime properties with
`resetprop`. While that valid snapshot remains, the module's early boot hook
reapplies the paired properties before Android framework values are cached;
keymint also reapplies them at startup. A manually configured exact date
without the snapshot continues to use the normal configuration behavior. After a
successful sync or restore, the WebUI reports completion and asks you to reboot;
it does not reboot the device automatically.

**Restore default security patch** does not use the network. It restores both
runtime properties from the saved snapshot, sets `security_patch`,
`os_patchlevel`, `vendor_patchlevel`, and `boot_patchlevel` to `auto`, and then
deletes the snapshot. These runtime properties are global for the current boot,
so other processes can observe the synchronized or restored values. A failed
operation is reported, property writes are rolled back when a later step fails,
and a snapshot needed for another restore attempt is retained.

**Spoof PIF fingerprint** downloads the current Pixel device catalog and the
selected profile from the `bot` branch of `KOWX712/PlayIntegrityFix`. That feed
is generated daily from Google's Android preview pages, Android Flash Tool
metadata, and Pixel security bulletin. The native helper validates the
catalog, the four profile fields, and the complete fingerprint structure. It
then derives the matching Build fields and atomically stores the active profile
at `/data/misc/keystore/omk/data/pif_fingerprint.json`. OMK's own Zygisk
payload applies these values inside newly started
`com.google.android.gms.unstable` and `com.android.vending` processes (including
their named `:...` child processes) through the Zygisk Next loader. During
pre-app specialization it installs available PLT hooks and, on AArch64, tries a
process-wide bionic callback hook only after validating the wrapper semantics,
memory mappings, and BTI/MTE permissions. A rejected callback hook leaves libc
unchanged, records the reason, and continues with the available PLT and Java
paths. Java `Build` fields and a property probe are updated after
specialization.
Zygisk Next must already be
installed and enabled by the user; OMK does not bundle, install, or implement
that loader. The selected values are process-local, are not global Android
properties, and do not change OMK's `[device]` identity. Disabling the action
removes the OMK profile and restarts the affected processes so their next
instances use the original values.

The ADB Disabler action stores four strict `0/1` values in
`/data/misc/keystore/omk/data/adb_disabler.conf`. When enabled, the selected
settings are applied immediately and replayed by the module service at every
boot. Disabling the master switch stops future replay; it intentionally does
not restore properties already changed during the current boot.

The security-patch and PIF network actions use the bundled native HTTPS client
and require neither `curl` nor `wget`. Other WebUI operations remain local.
The WebUI can also read and replace `scoop` and select a local XML file from
shared storage or through another installed file app to replace the active OMK
keybox. The security-patch actions do not change secrets, identity fields, or
other settings.

When the module is uninstalled from KernelSU, its bundled uninstaller removes
exactly `/data/adb/omk` and `/data/misc/keystore/omk`, including OMK-created key
data. This is irreversible and can require affected apps to register or sign in
again; disabling the module does not remove the directories. Reboot after an
uninstall.

Saving `scoop` is delegated to the native `inject` helper, which validates the
current configuration and package names before atomically replacing
`injector.toml`. Installing a keybox is delegated to the native `keymint`
helper. That helper checks the size, decodes UTF-8, and performs the complete
in-memory `KeyBox` validation before atomically replacing the canonical
lowercase `/data/misc/keystore/omk/keybox.xml`. A failed read, size, UTF-8,
validation, or write leaves the corresponding active file unchanged. The
appropriate watcher loads a successful change automatically, so a restart is
normally unnecessary.

Third-party source and licensing details for the adapted WebUI are listed in
[Third-Party Software](docs/THIRD_PARTY.md).

## Restarting keymint and injector

The module ships two background daemons: one for `keymint`, one for `injector`.
You can restart them by following commands.

```sh
touch /data/adb/omk/restart.keymint
touch /data/adb/omk/restart.injector
touch /data/adb/omk/restart.all
```

See the [Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#how-changes-are-loaded) for
which changes need a component restart or a full device reboot.
